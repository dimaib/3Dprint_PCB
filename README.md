# 3D printer Dual
## Description
A board for controlling all parts of a dual-extruder 3D printer.
- Allows you to control 6 stepper motors
- Table heating 110-230V
- Chamber heating 110-230V
- Heat control of two extruders
- Connection of various limit switches
- Connecting the LCD display
- Printer management via web interface via TCP/IP
>This board is controlled by [RepRapFirmware](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap_Firmware) ([GitHub](https://github.com/reprappro/RepRapFirmware))

RepRapFirmware has been optimized and redesigned for the STM32F407VGT controller architecture

## Tools and softwire
- The printed circuit board and circuit diagram of the device are created in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/)
- 3D models for PCB components were created in SOLIDWORKS
- Firmware edit in [Atollic TrueSTUDIO for STM32](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/truestudio.html) in C languages
